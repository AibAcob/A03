Part 1

How to use Git and Github

Use any text editor that you are comfortable with 
  Notepad, Notepad++, TextEdit, etc.
  
Type anything in the text editor 
  For example: "Welcome to my store"

Proceed to save your file in the text editor
  Once this is saved, it will create a milestone in your drive that consists of the saved text.
    When you open up your text editor again, you will be able to retreive the milestone that you have already created 
    
When opened, you can change anything within the file and save it again
  When you save it again after making any changes to your file, it will overwrite any previous data that you have put into the document. 
  
Git can also save any milestones within milestones
  By doing this, you can revisit previous saved files within the milestone so you can see what changes you have made without having to retype anything.
  
There is also a feature that allows you to save milestones in the cloud
  Getting to these milestones in the cloud is quite simple 
  You first go to Github, select Git, then finally press save again
  
You can also clone a repository on another computer, just in case you do not have access to your main computer. You can see everything that has been saved on the file from a different computer as long as it is saved in the github repository as well. This is great for sharing code with teammates or acquantances. 

When setting up a new project:
  1. Open .md file from the text editor
  2. Open Github
        a. Create a new project
  3. Find out the clone url 
  4. Add the remote
     
When finished with a project, you first have to create a feature branch. Once complete, you have to update the version history in your .md file.
